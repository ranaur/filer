Here’s a CI workflow configuration that will automatically run your pytest suite on every push and pull request.

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    └── ci.yml
```

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -e .
          pip install pytest

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest -v
```

---

This workflow will:
- Run on pushes and pull requests targeting `main`.
- Test across Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.
- Install your package in editable mode and run the full pytest suite with verbose output.
